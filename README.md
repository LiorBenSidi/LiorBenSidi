### üß© About Me

I‚Äôm a third-year **Information Systems Engineering student at the Technion**, blending data analysis, programming, and design thinking to build meaningful, data-driven systems.  

Curious by nature and structured by training, I enjoy turning complex problems into clear, elegant solutions ‚Äî whether through SQL queries, Python scripts, or UX prototypes.

I thrive at the intersection of **data, logic, and creativity**, and believe that good engineering is not only about code efficiency but also about human impact.

### üíº Projects & Assignments

#### [Database Management System](https://github.com/LiorBenSidi/Final_Project)
Developed an ERD-based relational system in SQL Server with a normalized schema, constraints, views, and complex queries with basic optimization, along with a Django app that includes validated forms and HTML/CSS, emphasizing data integrity.

#### [Human-Centered Design Portal](https://github.com/LiorBenSidi/UX-Final_Project)
Applied UX/UI and interaction design to redesign the Technion SAP degree-request portal, involving user research, Figma prototyping, and usability testing.

#### [Intro to Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/LiorBenSidi/Mini-Project)
Performed exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and built a classifier to predict key patterns in dataset behavior, resulting in a comprehensive data-driven report.

#### [AI Agents](https://github.com/LiorBenSidi/HW_AI)
- Built a multi-agent A* planner with domain-specific heuristics for fast, near-optimal scheduling.
- Developed a knowledge-based inference system under partial observability.
- Implemented stochastic MDP agents with heuristic and optimal Value Iteration policies.

#### [Data Structures & Algorithms ‚Äì Java Programming Assignment](https://github.com/LiorBenSidi/DS-Alg_Project)
Built a dynamic Java data structure to manage and query runners‚Äô statistics, using 2‚Äì3 balanced trees for efficient operations.<br/>
Implemented OOP-based classes (Runner, Run, Race) supporting insertion, deletion, and statistical queries with logarithmic complexity.<br/>
Enhanced proficiency in Java, algorithm optimization, and data structure design.

#### Machine Learning 1 ‚Äì Homework Assignments: [HW1](https://github.com/LiorBenSidi/HW1_ML1) | [HW2](https://github.com/LiorBenSidi/HW2_ML1)
-Completed four intensive assignments exploring core Machine Learning algorithms in Python.
-What we explored:
  ‚Ä¢ Built a multi-class k-NN classifier from scratch with full support for Minkowski distances and smart tie-breaking.
  ‚Ä¢ Investigated bias-variance tradeoffs, learning curves, and model complexity using synthetic data.
  ‚Ä¢ Analyzed Soft SVMs with linear and polynomial kernels and visualized decision boundaries and margins.
  ‚Ä¢ Implemented both multi-class and kernelized Perceptron algorithms and evaluated performance on real datasets.
  ‚Ä¢ Worked with gradient descent, SGD, and RLM to optimize convex loss functions and understand regularization.
  ‚Ä¢ Derived the multiclass logistic regression formulation and applied it to probabilistic classification.
  ‚Ä¢ Ran a cross-validation SVM pipeline on Fashion-MNIST to tune hyperparameters and evaluate accuracy.
